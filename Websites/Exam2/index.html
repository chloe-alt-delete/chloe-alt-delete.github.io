            <img class="homeimage left" src="images/02.jpg" alt="The hotel">
            <p>At Family Pet Resort, we are an all-inclusive all-suites resort that provides everything for
                your pet during their stay with us. We are happy to provide every guest with plush
                bedding and plenty of toys, so thereâ€™s no need to bring any from home. We proudly serve
                Canidae brand Low Residue dog food; however, if you choose to provide your own food,
                please provide pre-measured baggies with feeding instructions. For those dogs with a
                sweet tooth, ice cream treats and biscuits are available, as well as gourmet stuffed kong
                treats.</p>

            <p>What do you have in mind when you think of a typical boarding kennel? You will not
                find a more elite kennel in Pennsylvania. Please come in and visit us and see for yourself
                what sets our family friendly resort apart from the other kennels. Our canine
                accommodations offer all the services you would expect from a five-star resort including
                room service, maid service, soothing music and clean & comfortable climate-controlled
                suites. Our state of the art facilities also exchange fresh air throughout the resort
                approximately 6 to 8 times per hour.</p>

            <p>Every dog gets our attention along with their needs. Our staff will even groom your dog (for a small extra fee of course). The dogs here are well cared for and played with every single day to keep them happy. Some even get to have fun in the snow!</p>
